- Fix hang which occurs when moving meter inputs to another source.
  - This is likely an SDL2 issue.
  - When "hung", both callbacks and the event loop are still working;
    no new audio is received, and the app fails to exit except via SIGKILL.
- Recently, I've seen vumeter crash the Xorg server.
    - Again, I suspect SDL2 skullduggery.
- Seeing as how this doesn't need a window toolkit, but only some simple drawing
  and canvas primitives, perhaps VUmeter should run on top of X11 and PulseAudio
  APIs: one thread reads the PA stream and writes the pointer offset to memory;
  another periodically reads the pointer offset from memory and updates the display.
- Clean/factor code.
- Find path for named font?
